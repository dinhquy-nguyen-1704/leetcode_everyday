# leetcode_everyday
Welcome to my **leetcode_everyday** repository! This repository contains solutions that I have worked on for problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/nguyendinhquy/) since May 2023.

## Objective
This repository serves as a personal journey through my self-study of data structures and algorithms. It is a testament to my progress and a platform to share the solutions I have crafted for LeetCode problems.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem has its own folder, named after the ID and name of the problem (e.g., `0001-two-sum`).
- Inside each problem folder, you will find a source code file containing my solution (e.g., `solution.py`), as well as a README describing the problem and my solution.
